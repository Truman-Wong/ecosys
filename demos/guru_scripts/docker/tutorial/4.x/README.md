# Query Examples 

## Node Pattern
Copy [q1a.gsql](./script/q1a.gsql) to your container. 

```sql
#enter the graph
USE GRAPH financialGraph

//create a query
CREATE OR REPLACE QUERY q1a () SYNTAX v3 {

  // select from a node pattern-- symbolized by ()
  // v is a vertex set variable, holding the selected vertex set
  v = SELECT a
      FROM (a:Account);

  // output vertex set variable v in JSON format
  PRINT v;
}

#compile and install the query as a stored procedure
install query q1a

#run the query
run query q1a()
```

Think the matched node as a table with column (a). You can group by on the matched node table, just as you group by a table and aggregate in SQL. 

Copy [q1b.gsql](./script/q1b.gsql) to your container. 

```sql
#enter the graph
USE GRAPH financialGraph

CREATE OR REPLACE QUERY q1b () SYNTAX v3 {
  //think the FROM clause as a table with column (a)
  // you can group by using a and its attribute. 
  SELECT a.isBlocked, count(*) INTO T
  FROM (a:Account)
  GROUP BY a.isBlocked;

  PRINT T;
}

#compile and install the query as a stored procedure
install query q1b

#run the query
run query q1b()
```

## Edge Pattern 
Copy [q2a.gsql](./script/q2a.gsql) to your container. 

```sql

USE GRAPH financialGraph

# create a query
CREATE OR REPLACE QUERY q2 (string accntName) SYNTAX v3 {

  // declare an local sum accumulator; you can keep adding values into it
  // "local accumulator" means each vertex will have an accumulator of
  // the declared type and can be accumulated into based on the 
  // FROM clause pattern.
  SumAccum<int> @totalTransfer = 0;

  // match an edge pattern-- symbolized by ()-[]->()
  // v is a vertex set variable holding the selected vertex set
  v = SELECT b
      FROM (a:Account {name: accntName})-[e:transfer]->(b:Account)
      //for each matched row, do the following accumulation
      ACCUM  b.@totalTransfer += e.amount;

  //output each v and their static attribute and runtime accumulators' state
  PRINT v;

}

#compile and install the query as a stored procedure
install query q2

#run the query
run query q2("Scott")
```

You can group by on the matched edge table, just as you group by a table and aggregate in SQL. 

Copy [q2b.gsql](./script/q2b.gsql) to your container. 

```sql
USE GRAPH financialGraph

CREATE OR REPLACE QUERY q2b () SYNTAX v3 {

  //think the FROM clause is a matched table with columns (a, e, b)
  //you can use SQL syntax to group by the source and target account, and sum the total transfer amount
  SELECT a, b, sum(e.amount)  INTO T
  FROM (a:Account)-[e:transfer]->(b:Account)
  GROUP BY a, b;

  //output the table in JSON format
  PRINT T;

}

#compile and install the query as a stored procedure
install query q2b

#run the query
run query q2b()
```

## Path Pattern 

### Fixed Length Path Pattern
Copy [q3a.gsql](./script/q3a.gsql) to your container. 

```sql
USE GRAPH financialGraph

// create a query
CREATE OR REPLACE QUERY q3 (datetime low, datetime high, string accntName) SYNTAX v3 {

  // a path pattern in ascii art () -[]->()-[]->()
  R = SELECT b
      FROM (a:Account {name: accntName})-[e:transfer]->()-[e2:transfer]->(b:Account)
      WHERE e.date >= low AND e.date <= high and e.amount >500 and e2.amount>500;

      PRINT R;

  // below we use variable length path.
  // *1.. means 1 to more steps of the edge type "transfer"
  // select the reachable end point and bind it to vertex alias "b"
  R = SELECT b
      FROM (a:Account {name: accntName})-[:transfer*1..]->(b:Account);

      PRINT R;

}

install query q3

run query q3("2024-01-01", "2024-12-31", "Scott")
```
You can group by on the matched path table, just as you group by a table and aggregate in SQL. 

### Variable Length Path Pattern
Copy [q3b.gsql](./script/q3b.gsql) to your container. 

```sql
USE GRAPH financialGraph

// create a query
CREATE OR REPLACE QUERY q3b (datetime low, datetime high, string accntName) SYNTAX v3 {

   // a path pattern in ascii art () -[]->()-[]->()
   // think the FROM clause is a matched table with columns (a, e, b, e2, c)
   // you can use SQL syntax to group by on the matched table
   // Below query find 2-hop reachable account c from a, and group by the path a, b, c
   // find out how much each hop's total transfer amount.
   SELECT a, b, c, sum(DISTINCT e.amount) AS hop_1_sum,  sum(DISTINCT e2.amount) AS hop_2_sum INTO T1
   FROM (a:Account)-[e:transfer]->(b)-[e2:transfer]->(c:Account)
   WHERE e.date >= low AND e.date <= high
   GROUP BY a, b, c;

   PRINT T1;

   /* below we use variable length path.
      *1.. means 1 to more steps of the edge type "transfer"
      select the reachable end point and bind it to vertex alias "b"
     note: 
      1. the path has "shortest path" semantics. If you have a path that is longer than the shortest,
      we only count the shortest. E.g., scott to scott shortest path length is 4. Any path greater than 4 will
      not be matched.
     2. we can not put an alias to bind the edge in the the variable length part -[:transfer*1..]->, but 
     we can bind the end points (a) and (b) in the variable length path, and group by on them.
   */
   SELECT a, b, count(*) AS path_cnt INTO T2
   FROM (a:Account {name: accntName})-[:transfer*1..]->(b:Account)
   GROUP BY a, b;

   PRINT T2;

}

install query q3b

run query q3b("2024-01-01", "2024-12-31", "Scott")
```

# Advanced Topics
## Accumulators
GSQL is a Turing-complete graph database query language. One of its key advantages over other graph query languages is its support for accumulators, which can be either global or vertex local. An accumulator is a state variable in GSQL. Its state is mutable throughout the life cycle of a query.

**Accumulator Supported Operators**
An accumulator in GSQL supports two operators: assignment (=) and accumulation (+=).

- `=` operator: The assignment operator can be used to reset the state of an accumulator or its current value.

- `+=` operator: The accumulation operator can be used to add new values to the accumulatorâ€™s state. Depending on the type of accumulator, different accumulation semantics are applied.

```sql
USE GRAPH financialGraph

CREATE OR REPLACE DISTRIBUTED QUERY a1 (/* parameters */) SYNTAX v3 {

    SumAccum<INT> @@sum_accum = 0;
    MinAccum<INT> @@min_accum = 0;
    MaxAccum<INT> @@max_accum = 0;
    AvgAccum @@avg_accum;
    OrAccum @@or_accum = FALSE;
    AndAccum @@and_accum = TRUE;
    ListAccum<INT> @@list_accum;

    // @@sum_accum will be 3 when printed
    @@sum_accum +=1;
    @@sum_accum +=2;
    PRINT @@sum_accum;

    // @@min_accum will be 1 when printed
    @@min_accum +=1;
    @@min_accum +=2;
    PRINT @@min_accum;

    // @@max_accum will be 2 when printed
    @@max_accum +=1;
    @@max_accum +=2;
    PRINT @@max_accum;

    @@avg_accum +=1;
    @@avg_accum +=2;
    PRINT @@avg_accum;

    // @@or_accum will be TRUE when printed
    @@or_accum += TRUE;
    @@or_accum += FALSE;
    PRINT @@or_accum;

    // @@and_accum will be FALSE when printed
    @@and_accum += TRUE;
    @@and_accum += FALSE;
    PRINT @@and_accum;

    // @@list_accum will be [1,2,3,4] when printed
    @@list_accum += 1;
    @@list_accum += 2;
    @@list_accum += [3,4];
    PRINT @@list_accum;

}

//install the query
install query  a1

//run the query
run query a1()
```  
In the above example, six different accumulator variables (those with prefix @@) are declared, each with a unique type. Below we explain the semantics and usage of them.

- `SumAccum<INT>` allows user to keep adding INT values

- `MinAccum<INT>` keeps the smallest INT number it has seen. As the @@min_accum statements show, we accumulated 1 and 2 to the MinAccum accumulator, and end up with the value 0, as neither of 1 nor 2 is smaller than the initial state value 0.

- `MaxAccum<INT>` is the opposite of MinAccum. It returns the MAX INT value it has seen. The max_accum statements accumulate 1 and 2 into it, and end up with the value 2.

-  `AvgAccum` keeps the average value it has seen. It returns the AVG INT value it has seen. The avg_accum statements accumulate 1 and 2 into it, and end up with the value 1.5.

- `OrAccum` keeps OR-ing the internal boolean state variable with new boolean variables that accumulate to it. The initial default value is assigned FALSE. We accumulate TRUE and FALSE into it, and end up with the TRUE value.

- `AndAccum` is symmetric to OrAccum. Instead of using OR, it uses the AND accumulation semantics. We accumulate TRUE and FALSE into it, and end up with the FALSE value.

- `ListAccum<INT>` keeps appending new integer(s) into its internal list variable. We append 1, 2, and [3,4] to the accumulator, and end up with [1,2,3,4].
